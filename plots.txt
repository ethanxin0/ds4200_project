- First Plot, Examining Peak player performance age
    - 

- Second Plot, Potential Correlations Between Age and Goals + Assists Recorded
    - We wanted to see quantifiying numbers between ages and goals scored in the top five leagues,
    thus we decided to create two boxplots, one for age, and one for Goals + Assits recorded. The marks 
    in these box plots are the boxes, median line, whiskers, and some outlier points. Some channels we had
    were the positinioning of the boxes, each box to represent different leagues and the color of the boxes.

-Third Plot, Goal Distribution by Position
    -

- Fourth Plot, Top 50 Goals + Assists by Defenders
    -

- Fifth Plot, Where the Best Offensive Players Come From
    - In this plot, we wanted to examine where the best offensive players, quantified by Goals + Assits, originate
    from. By using geopandas, we created a world map, colored by how many goals + assits players from their respective
    countries producded in the top five leagues. Leading the way are France and Spain, not a huge suprise. Some Marks we used 
    in this graph are the countries themselves, and the color gradient. Some channels we used was the interactive tooltip, the
    boundareis of the countries and the color as well.
