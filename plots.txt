- First Plot, Examining Peak player performance age
    -  This visualization highlights the relationship between player age and goals per 90 minutes. It reveals that the majority 
    of players fall within the age range of 20 to 30, which also corresponds to the period of peak performance for scoring goals.
    Players in this range exhibit higher variability in goals per 90 minutes, with a few outliers achieving exceptional goal-scoring 
    rates of over 4 or even 6 goals per 90 minutes. In contrast, younger players (under 20) and older players (over 35) tend to have
     lower goal-scoring rates, clustering around 0-1 goals per 90 minutes. The marks in this graph are the scatter points. The channels
     are the x and y position of the marks, the hue/color of the points.

- Second Plot, Box Plots Between Age and Goals + Assists Recorded
    - We wanted to see quantifiying numbers between ages and goals scored in the top five leagues,
    thus we decided to create two boxplots, one for age, and one for Goals + Assits recorded. The marks 
    in these box plots are the boxes, median line, whiskers, and some outlier points. Some channels we had
    were the positinioning of the boxes, each box to represent different leagues and the color of the boxes.

-Third Plot, Goal Distribution by Position
    - This visualization illustrates the distribution of goals scored by players in different positions across Europe's
    top five leagues. It provides a clear picture of which roles are more likely to contribute to scoring, highlighting
    the importance of strikers and attacking midfielders in goal-scoring activities. The data shows that forwards and
    wingers tend to score the most, reflecting their primary role on the pitch. However, it also reveals that some defensive 
    positions, such as center-backs, can occasionally make significant contributions, especially from set pieces. This insight
    is valuable for understanding team strategies and player roles within the context of modern football. The marks used 
    were bars within a bar chart. The channels are the x and y axis, the x being player names a categorical variable and 
    they being a quantitative variable which is goals scored. The remaining channels are the title text describing what the
    visual shows and the interactive element where you can filter by overall position. 


- Fourth Plot, Top 15 Goals + Assists by Defenders
    - The interactive chart above showcases the top 15 defenders based on a combination of key performance indicators, including tackles,
    interceptions, clearances, and blocks. Users can explore the data by interacting with the chart, allowing them to sort and filter
    defenders according to various metrics. This tool is particularly useful for identifying standout performers and analyzing trends
    in defensive play. Notably, the chart highlights the balance between physicality and technical skills required at the highest level,
    as well as the increasing emphasis on ball-playing abilities among defenders. Such an analysis supports a deeper appreciation of
    the evolving nature of defensive roles in contemporary football. The marks used were bars within a bar chart. The channels are 
    the x and y axis, the x being player names a categorical variable and the y being a quantitative variable which is goals scored. 
    The remaining channels are the title text describing what the visual shows and the interactive element where you can filter by
    defensive position.

- Fifth Plot, Where the Best Offensive Players Come From
    - In this plot, we wanted to examine where the best offensive players, quantified by Goals + Assits, originate
    from. By using geopandas, we created a world map, colored by how many goals + assits players from their respective
    countries producded in the top five leagues. Leading the way are France and Spain, not a huge suprise. Some Marks we used 
    in this graph are the countries themselves, and the color gradient. Some channels we used was the interactive tooltip, the
    boundareis of the countries and the color as well.
 
- Sixth Plot, Progressive Passes Forward vs Goals Scored
    - This D3 Visualization demonstrates the relationship plotted on a scatter plot between Progressive Passes Forward and Goals grouped
     by team and plotted on each subplot by league. Progressive passes are defined as passes that move the ball upfield and into attacking positions. 
     In the graph, a clear positive linear relationship is presented, meaning that teams that play more forward passes tend to score more goals. 
     In the new era of soccer, a style known as playing out the back has become more prevalant, in which players will often play back to the
     goalkeeper or centerbacks and then play the ball foward. The marks in this graph are the scatter plot points. The channels are the position,
     the color of the points, which represents the respective league, and the positinioning of the points.
