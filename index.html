<h1>Analyzing Player Performance in Europe's Top 5 Leagues: A Data-Driven Approach for the 2023/2024 Season</h1>

<h2>Our Central Goal</h2>
    <p> Football continues to captivate global audiences, with Europe's top five leagues (Premier League, La Liga, 
        Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1)at the peak of competitive football. Understanding player performance is
        crucial for clubs, analysts, and fans, and data-driven insights can significantly enhance this understanding.
        This project uses a detailed dataset from the 2023/2024 season, containing a wide range of player statistics 
        such as matches played, goals, assists, minutes on the field, and advanced metrics like expected goals (xG)
        and progressive carries. The dataset includes critical information about each player's performance, 
        such as nationality, position, age, and contributions regarding goals, assists, and defensive actions. 
        Advanced metrics such as expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xAG) provide additional layers of insight
        into player contributions beyond traditional stats. For example, xG quantifies the quality of a player's
        chances based on the location of their shots, while progressive passes and carries illustrate a player's 
        ability to move the ball forward. Analyzing this dataset allows us to identify standout players, evaluate
        their overall impact on team performance, and draw meaningful conclusions about playing styles across 
        different leagues. Understanding these dynamics is vital for appreciating the game and scouting, 
        strategic planning, and enhancing player development.

<h2> A Brief Overview of our Data </h2>
    <p> 
        Our data contains soccer player statistics for the top five European Soccer Leagues. This includes the Premier League, 
        Ligue 1, La Liga, Serie A, and Bundesliga. We found this dataset on Kaggle. It contains roughly 2700 rows, 
        has more than 20 columns, and contains both categorical and numerical attributes. Some columns to highlight
        are Minutes played, # of Starts, Age, Position, Expected Goals, and etc. We can access this data either through
        the Kaggle API or just by downloading the CSV (607 kB). 
        For the first couple rows, it appears that the data is cleaned already,
        making it easy to use for plotting and analysis if necessary.
